Qt AccountsService binding
==========================

Qt-style API to use freedesktop.org's AccountsService DBus service.

For more information see:
    http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/AccountsService

No build dependencies besides Qt 5.x, but to use this library you need
the AccountsService daemon running.


## TODO

- [ ] Migrate to the latest AccountsService, for example, SetPassword support
